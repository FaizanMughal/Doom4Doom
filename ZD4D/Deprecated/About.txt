This folder keeps all the old subsystems used in the past that have gradually
become outdated and replaced over the years. Feel free to play around with them
as you wish, but know that some systems may be missing key components. You will
need to get those components from the older releases if you want to properly work
with them.

Being deprecated means no support is offered for these entities.

Like anything else in this mod, you are free to do with them as you will. Make
something better if you want to and show me. I'd love to see it when finished!
