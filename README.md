# Contribution Rules
These rules are for contributing directly towards Doom4Doom via pull requests.

1. **No DECORATE or ACS allowed.** 
  * DECORATE is now deprecated entirely. There's not a shred of DECORATE left except for the damagetypes.
  * Anything you can do in ACS can now be done in ZScript. If you need help, ask.
2. **Detail your commits.** 
  * You must specify all that has changed if you wish to have a higher chance of acceptance.
3. **Notify us of defects/caveats.**  
  * If you know there are issues or problems, tell us and we'll help you work out what said problems are.
4. **Rejections may not be final.** 
  * If you are asked to change something, chances are the Pull Request may not be closed. It all depends on how big and complex the code is.
  * Pull requests may be contested with the primary developers at any time, which may delay the process.
  * If a PR is ultimately declined for a specific permanent reason, it is considered final and should be dropped.
5. **Use a program like SourceTree or GitKraken to upload files.**
  * Avoid using GitHub directly. With the aforementioned programs, you can commit all your files at once versus one at a time.
  * You only need one of these.
  * SourceTree: https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/
  * GitKraken: https://www.gitkraken.com/
6. **Use proper indentation.**
  * Tabs, not spaces, should be used when making adjustments. As such, you should use a programming notepad or SLADE to perform the edits.
7. **Notify us.**
  * While I do have the email system set up, sometimes I miss the notification from being gone.
