# Contribution Rules
These rules are for contributing directly towards Doom4Doom via pull requests.

1. **No DECORATE allowed.** 
  * DECORATE is now considered a thing of the past now that ZScript is on the rise for this mod. 
2. **Detail your commits.** 
  * You must specify all that has changed if you wish to have a higher chance of acceptance.
3. **Notify us of defects/caveats.**  
  * If you know something doesn't work, or there is a potential issue, tell us. We will port it over into a branch and help you figure out what the problem is, so you can see your code merged with ours even sooner.
4. **Rejections may not be final.** 
  * If you are asked to change something, chances are the Pull Request may not be closed. It all depends on how big and complex the code is.
  * Pull requests may be contested with the primary developers at any time, which may delay the process.
  * If a PR is ultimately declined for a specific permanent reason, it is considered final and should be dropped.
5. **Use a program like SourceTree or GitKraken to upload files.**
  * Avoid using GitHub directly. With the aforementioned programs, you can commit all your files at once versus one at a time.
  * You only need one of these.
  * SourceTree: https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/
  * GitKraken: https://www.gitkraken.com/
6. **Use proper indentation.**
  * Tabs, not spaces, should be used when making adjustments. As such, you should use a programming notepad or SLADE to perform the edits.
7. **Be Patient.**
  * We all have lives to deal with. It may take time to go through and sort out all the issues and pull requests, depending. If you have the mail system set up and watch this project, you'll be notified of any activity pertaining to the issue/pull request.
