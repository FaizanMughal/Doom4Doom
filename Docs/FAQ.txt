Doom(4) for Doom / D4D
Frequently Asked Questions

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v2.x-
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q. 	What is this?
A.	"Doom(4) for Doom" (D4D) is a gameplay mod that brings the Doom 2016 weapons 
	into the classic Doom maps via GZDoom. It also brings some similar monsters 
	minus the dynamic AI and mobility.

Q.	What should I expect?
A.	The mod tries to bring the weapons as accurately as possible in looks, 
	behavior and timings. However, we also took some liberties regarding some 
	behaviors and balance. For example, the "Double Trouble" Super Shotgun, 
	when ported directly became extremely overpowered, so we reworked it 
	completely. Another instance is the "Gatling Rotator" mod for the Chaingun, 
	which fires explosive rounds now. There are many more for you to discover.

Q. 	Does it include every single weapon in Doom 4 + multiplayer weapons?
A. 	Not every single one of them. All the single player weapons are there, 
	and some of the multiplayer ones. The rest may come in time.

Q. Do the single player weapons have all the mods and upgrades?
A. Mods: yes. Upgrades: no.
   In D4D all moddable weapons have their respective mods, but once acquired, 
   they don't have "upgrades". All mods are in a fixed upgrade state compared to 
   Doom 4. When you get "Micro Missiles" for the HAR, they will be "Bottomless" 
   already. Another example, the "Lock On" Rocket Launcher mod, when acquired, 
   will not have the multiple targets upgrade, instead, it stays the way it is 
   when picked. 
   Some weapons, like Super Shotgun, or the MP weapons, do have a few upgrades 
   you can buy to enhance, since they don't have mods.

Q.	Can I run it with Brutal Doom?
A.	Never. "Brutal Doom" and "Doom(4) for Doom" are both gameplay mods that cannot be stacked on top of each other. Same goes for any pair of gameplay mods.

Q. 	Can I run it with enhancement packs (high res textures, custom decorations, terrain packs)?
A. 	Most cases: yes. If the pack in question doesn't alter gameplay or alter 
	monster looks/behaviour, it should run fine along D4D. However, if the pack 
	defines its custom monsters to add extra gore, effects, etc, it's very 
	likely that it will end up messing up D4D.

Q.	Can I run this in Zandronum and/or multiplayer?
A.	This mod is specifically designed for GZDoom since it uses really new 
	features of the engine. If Zandronum catches up with the GZDoom development, 
	it could be playable in single player. Multiplayer is not currently 
	supported and will probably glitch out if attempted.

Q.	Does this mod have "ledge grabbing" and "glory kills"?
A.	Yes.

Q.	What about double jump?
A.	It's there, but it's completely optional and can be turned on/off at any moment.

Q.	Are the custom monsters a separate addon?
A.	No. They are part of the core D4D. However, you can select the option to play 
	with classic Doom(2) monsters instead of D4D's. The classic monsters have 
	zero changes regarding behavior/damage/balance compared to the originals. 
	They do, however, have slightly updated visual effects. Keep in mind that 
	the classic Doom monsters tend to be easier to deal with than their D4D 
	counterparts. 

Q.	Are the skill levels untouched?
A.	No. D4D has new skill levels. In general, it makes the game harder, and 
	Ultra Violence remains ultraviolence despite being higher up in the list of 
	skills. The skills below that one are way harder and are not recommended for 
	players that don't like challenges. Keep in mind, however, that you can 
	select easier skills, or, as mentioned above, use the classic Doom monsters 
	to play a difficulty combination that better fits your style.

Q.	Do weapons have reloading?
A.	No.

Q.	Will you add maps?
A.	If people want to make some maps for it, they are more than welcome to. 
	I personally don't map at all.

v3.0+
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q.	What are lives?
A.	Lives are like an arcade game's life bonus. However, instead of dying, you
	teleport to a location you were at a few seconds ago, provided you aren't
	stuck, and you gain a short moment of invulnerability with full health.

Q.	What is the Akimbo system and what (dis)advantages does it bring?
A.	You can use two guns at once and go crazy with your trigger fingers for a
	rewarding challenge. But you can't grab ledges or perform melee kills.
	
Q.	What happened to the old holograph menu?
A.	Due to engine limitations, it was removed. It will return in a different form
	though, and for now it's simply a regular ZDoom menu for the time being.
	
Q.	What is the difference between Credits and Crates modes?
A.	Credits you can spend at your leisure on crates AND purchasing upgrades.
	Crates cannot be spent on anything except its namesake, and upgrades drop from
	monsters in this mode.
	
Q.	What is Rainbow Doom(4)?
A.	My take on Colourful Hell.

Q.	Multiplayer?
A.	GZDoom only unless Zandronum catches up.
